# 🏠 Smart Home System using ESP32

## 📌 Overview
This project is an ESP32-based Smart Home system supporting both
automatic and manual control modes.  
The system is designed as a complete embedded solution including
firmware development and single-layer PCB design, and is integrated
with Home Assistant using ESPHome.
